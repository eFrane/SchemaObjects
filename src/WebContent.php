/**
 * WebContent is a type representing all [[WebPage]], [[WebSite]] and
 * [[WebPageElement]] content. It is sometimes the case that detailed distinctions
 * between Web pages, sites and their parts is not always important or obvious. The
 *  [[WebContent]] type makes it easier to describe Web-addressable content without
 * requiring such distinctions to always be stated. (The intent is that the
 * existing types [[WebPage]], [[WebSite]] and [[WebPageElement]] will eventually
 * be declared as subtypes of [[WebContent]]).
